# PyBer_Analysis

The aim of this project is to summarize the ride-sharing data for the first quarter of 2019 according to the classification given to the cities as either urban, suburban or rural types. 

This classification is then used quantify the total driver, rides, fares and the average driver and ride fare per city type to identify trends and differences in the service depending on the area.

## Overview of Project

![Pyber_Summary](/Analysis/Pyber_summary_DF.png)

### Urban Cities

The urban cities have the highest ride and driver amount at 1625 and 2405 respectively, as well as the highest fares ($39,854.38). This is the only city type in which there are more drivers than rides. 

The average fare per ride is calculated by dividing the total fare ($39,854.38) by the number of rides. This means that each ride in our urban cities earns us $24.53. 

The average fare per driver is calculated by dividing the total fare ($39,854.38) by the number of drivers which results in earnings of $16.57 per each driver in urban cities.

Urban cities have a higher demand for a pyber ride; however according to our Q1 results, not every driver in urban cities could provide a ride. The ride/driver index for urban cities is 0.675. Whenver this index goes below 1 means that the Fare per Ride will be higher than the Fare per Driver.

### Suburban Cities

The suburban cities have the second highest ride and driver amount at 625 and 490 respectively, as well as the second highest fares ($19,356.33). Suburban cities have a demand for thats 2.6 times lower than urban cities while the fare is 2.05 times less than urban cities.

The average fare per ride is calculated by dividing the total fare ($19,356.33) by the number of rides. This means that each ride in our suburban cities earns us $30.97	

The average fare per driver is calculated by dividing the total fare ($19,356.33) by the number of rides. This means that each ride in our suburban cities earns us $39.50

Suburban cities have a noticeably lower demand for rides; however the fare per ride is higher.

In this case, the ride/driver index is 1.27, this means that each driver in suburban cities drove at least 1 ride during our first quarter, hence why the fare per driver is above the fare per ride.

### Rural Cities

Rural cities have the lowest ride and driver count at 125 and 78 respectively, the total fare in these cities is $4,327.93. Rural cities have 13 times less rides and 30.83 times less drivers than urban cities. 

The average fare per ride is calculated by dividing the total fare ($4,327.93) by the number of rides. This means that each ride in our rural cities earns us $34.62.	

The average fare per driver is calculated by dividing the total fare ($4,327.93) by the number of rides. This means that each ride in our rural cities earns us $55.49.

Rural cities have a really low ride count; the ride/driver index in them is 1.60, meaning that each driver contributed with at least 1.6 rides during our 2019 first quarter.

### Purpose

By analyzing our performance in the different city types in which Pyber provides its service, we can design new business strategies to both improve pyber's earnings, and provide a more affordable price to rural areas. 

The analysis will also consider the earnings on a weekly basis for the first quarter of 2019 to identify highs and lows in the demand and earnings. 

This information is useful to know how the market differs according to the city type. With a clear knowledge of what each city requires, we can implement much more effective strategies that are adjusted to each city type.
